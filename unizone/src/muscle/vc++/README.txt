In this directory you will find Visual C++ 6 project files created 
by yours truly (Vitaliy :) ). 

To compile muscle, do the following:

1. Open the "muscle.dsw" project file in VC++

2. Set the active configuration to "Release": 
      Build->Set Active Configuration->muscle - Win32 Release. 

3. Now press "F7" to build the library. 

4. This will create a "muscle.lib" static library in the same folder 
   as the VC++ projects ("vc++" folder). 

5. Now open the "muscled.dsw" file. Set the active configuration to 
   "Release" and press "F7". This will create a "muscled.exe" file 
   in the "vc++" directory. Now you can just double-click it to run 
   the server :).
